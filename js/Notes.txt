Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
    - Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
    - Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
    - Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
    - Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
    - JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
        The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

JavaScript is Case Sensitive
